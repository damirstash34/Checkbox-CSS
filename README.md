# Checkbox-CSS
Custom checkbox on css for websites

If you are a frontend developer then you know that standard checkboxes in html are boring enough.
This css file will fix this and make checkboxes like on the phone.

Installation and use:

Transfer the checkbox.css file to the folder with the index.html (or index.php) file.

Further in the same file, write this line in the head tag:
`<link rel =" stylesheet "href =" checkbox.css ">`

All! Now all checkboxes will not be so boring (checkboxes in html are input tags with type = "checkbox" attribute).
